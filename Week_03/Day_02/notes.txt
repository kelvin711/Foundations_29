Structural elements
HTML5 introduces a number of semantic structural elements that can be used to configure specific areas on a web page

DIV
The div element has been used for many years to configure a generic structural area or “division” on a web page as a block display with empty space above and below.

HEADER
The div element has been used for many years to configure a generic structural area or “division” on a web page as a block display with empty space above and below.

NAV
The purpose of the nav element is to contain a section of navigation links.

MAIN
The purpose of the main element is to contain the main content of a web page document.

FOOTER
The purpose of the footer element is to contain the footer content of a web page or section of a web page.

SECTION
The purpose of a section element is to indicate a “section” of a document, such as a chapter or topic.

ARTICLE
The article element is intended to present an independent entry, such as a blog posting, comment, or e-zine article that could stand on its own.

ASIDE
The aside element indicates a sidebar or other tangential content.


The "cascade" order of presedence follows the order of 
Browser defaults -> external styles -> embedded styles -> inline styles

the default position for elements is static, meaning they follow the normal document flow.

postion relative is the same as static but allows us to use left, right, top and bottom to move the element. it takes the element out of the document flow

postion absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body,

An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
