Basic Terminal Commands for Mac/Linux

Present working directory
`pwd`
Use this command any time you are unsure where you are currently in your file structure. 
pwd stands for Present Working Directory. For Windows,you may either use pwd or cd.

create new files
`touch` (windows type nul >)

List files
`ls` (`dir` windows)
Use the ls command to see all the directories and files that are in your current directory. 
To clear things up, a directory is just a synonym for a folder. In 'cmd', use the dir command 
instead. add a `-l` to list and see a list form

 change directory command
`cd`
To move inside a subdirectory : to move inside a subdirectory in linux we use 
`cd "directory_name"`
`cd ~` or `cd` this command is used to change directory to the home directory. 
`cd ..` this command is used to move to the parent directory of current directory

Making a new folder
`mkdir "new_directory_name"`
This command will make a new directory named 'new_directory_name'. 
Whatever argument you pass into this command will be the name of your new file. After making 
the directory, you could run 'cd new_folder_name' to enter into that directory

Delete an empty directory(folder)
`rm "files_name"`
`rmdir "directory_name"`

Delete a non-empty directory(folder)
`rm -rf  "directory_name"` use this command with caution!

Renaming/Moving a file
`mv "index.html" "new_name_index.html"`
`mv "new_name_index.html" ../"new_name_index.html"`
The 'mv' command has two uses. First, you can rename a file by first providing the file's 
name and then providing what you want the file to be renamed to. In the first example, 
index.html would be renamed to new_name_index.html. Second, it can be used to move a file 
to a different folder. In the second example, new_name_index.html would be moved up one 
directory with the same name. In either case, think of this command as moving a file - 
into its current directory with a different name or into a different directory with the 
same or different name.
